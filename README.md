# Anemia-Analysis
Code for data manipulation of multiple CSV files from different sources in preparation for use with Tableau.

## Purpose
Combine and clean data from multiple websites to create a Tableau story about the prevelance of anemia in multiple countries in the world between the years of 2000-2019. Additional data such as median income, population estimates, GDP PPP, will be used to look at the relation between these variables and disease prevelence.
